Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on LLM-DSA (Domain-Specific Architecture for Large Language Models).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on LLM-DSA projects with guys with strong expertise in software-hardware co-design.
- ðŸŒ± I'm maintaining the micro-architecture simulator of XiangShan processor.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about performance evaluation (e.g., sampling), CPU performance optimization, and LLM-DSA.
